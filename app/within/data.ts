When we slow down enough to truly listen — not to fix or to force, but simply to hear — something extraordinary happens. The body exhales. It softens. It begins to tell the truth.",

I have come to understand prana less as an abstract concept and more as the living intelligence of sensation itself. When a hip releases in pigeon pose, that is prana speaking. When the chest floods with feeling in a backbend, that is prana saying: yes, here, feel this.",
